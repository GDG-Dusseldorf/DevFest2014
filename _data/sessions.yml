  title: "Machine Learning - Creating smart apps for smart devices"
  description: "Artificial intelligence and automated learning is a scientific approach to turn computers into smart machines, being capable to use acquired knowledge to master tasks autonomously, thus without instruction or supervision. The fundamental laws of learning theory apply in the same way as for animals or humans, where thorough knowledge has been acquired and used in education for decades. Though still a lot of mathematical and statistical methods are widely used for data analysis and processing, the focus is shifting towards the aspects of perception, training and optimization. Knowledge extraction and representation becomes an evolutionary process, the concluded behavioural rules being developed by adapting and improving them continuously while being used. After giving birth to new intelligent computer species by programmed code, they need education before and during their professional career serving us, others or themselves. The technical art of coding is complemented by the task of how to properly feed and train our electronic kids."

#   description: "Android wear extends the Android platform to a new generation of wearable devices. The user experience is designed specifically for wearables. In this session you’ll see how to use the Android Wear SDK to build a connected cloud-powered application. Using Android Studio and it’s cloud extensions, you’ll see how to build an app that ‘listens’ for changes in stock prices, and notifies a wearable device. You’ll also see how to use voice controls on the device to trigger interactions with the app, such as buying or selling the stock after a notification. Call to action: Get the SDK and start building apps today!"
